STK: A ToolKit of Audio Synthesis Classes and Instruments in C++
Release 3.0

By Perry R. Cook, 1995-99
and Gary P. Scavone, 1997-99

v3.0
- new #define flags for OS and realtime dependencies (this will probably cause problems for most everyone, but it was necessary to make future ports easier)
- fixed Linux MIDI input bug
- fixed MIDI status masking problem in Windows
- OS type defines now in Makefile
- new RAWWAVE_PATH define in Object.h
- syntmono pulled out to separate directory and cleaned up
- socketing capabilities under Unix, as well as Windoze
- multiple simultaneous socket client connections to STK servers now possible
- MD2SKINI now can merge MIDI and piped messages under Irix and Linux (for TCL->MD2SKINI->syntmono control)
- defined INT16 and INT32 types and fixed various WvIn and WvOut classes
- updated MatWvIn and MatWvOut for new MAT-file documentation from Matlab
- new demo GUI
- minor fixes to FM behavior
- added record/duplex capabilities to RTSoundIO (Linux, SGI, and Windoze)
- fixed bugs in WavWvOut and MatWvOut header specifications
- added RawWvOut class
- new WvIn class with RawWvIn, SndWvIn, WavWvIn, MatWvIn, and RTWvIn subclasses
- removed RawWave, RawShot, RawInterp, and RawLoop classes (supplanted by RawWvIn)
- multi-channel data support in WvIn and WvOut classes using MY_MULTI data type (pointer to MY_FLOAT) and the methods mtick() and mlastOutput()
- now writing to primary buffer under Windoze when allowed by hardware
- cleaned up Object.h a bit
- pulled various utility and thread functions out of syntmono.cpp (to aid readability of the code)


v2.02:
- 16 November 1998
- created RawWave abstract class, with subclasses of RawLoop (looping rawwave oscillator), RawShot (non-looping, non-interpolating rawwave player ... used to be RawWvIn), and RawInterp (looping or non-looping, interpolating rawwave player ... used to be RawWave).
- modified DrumSynt to correctly handle sample rates different than 22050 Hz.
- modified syntmono parsing vs. tick routine so that some ticking occurs between each message.  When multiple messages are waiting to be processed, the time between message updates is inversely proportional to the number of messages in the buffer.
- fixed DirectSound playback bug in Win distribution.  Sound was being played at 8-bit, 22 kHz in all cases.  Playback is now 16-bit and dependent on SRATE.
- fixed bug in MD2SKINI which prevented some NoteOff statements from being output.


v2.01:
- 27 July 1998
- Corrected extraneous ^M line return characters that were incompatible with SGI.


v2.0:
- 20 July 1998
- The first true release by Gary, with unified capabilities across SGI, Linux, and Win platforms.  See WWW pages (http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/CCRMA/Software/STK/) for more info.


v1.1:
- More linux support and other changes that happened so long ago that I can't remember anymore.  Never officially released.


v1.0:
- Linux support added with the help of Tim Stilson.  Never officially released.


v0.8:
- One of (if not THE) original distributions for SGI, NeXTStep, and basic Win support.  I think this came out in 1996.
