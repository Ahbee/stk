By Perry R. Cook, 1995-99

Please read the file README.txt for more general STK information.

It seems that SGI systems are not distributed with the GNU Makefile utilities.  The default Make utility has very limited functionality, so your safest bet is to download the GNU Makefile utilities from the Internet and use STK's default Makefile.  If this is not possible, try using Makefile.sgi (make -f Makefile.sgi).

Aside from the Makefile issues, STK should compile and run on SGI platforms without any problems.
